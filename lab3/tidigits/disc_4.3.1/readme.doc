This set of discs contains a corpus of speech which was designed and collected
at Texas Instruments (TI) for speaker-independent connected-digit automatic
speech recognition development and evaluation.  The corpus has been reformatted
and produced on CD-ROM by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) and is distributed with the permission of Texas Instruments.

The following top-level directories and files exist on each disc:

     readme.doc - This file.
    
     sphere/ - NIST SPeech HEader REsources (SPHERE).  C-language source
               code libraries and utilities for manipulating NIST-headered
               speech waveform files.  See "/sphere/readme.doc" for more
               information.
     
     tidigits/ - Connected-digit speech corpora and documentation.  See
                 "/tidigits/readme.doc" for more information.
